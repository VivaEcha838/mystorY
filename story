Title: The Hare and the Tortoise

Once upon a time in the jungle, there lived a hare and a toroise. They both lived in peace and harmony, but after a quarral, they split apart. 

The Hare started mocking the Tortoise because he was slow. The tortoise did not like this, so he said they would have a race, and whoever won would be the fastest.

The Hare accepted with the assumption that he would easily beat the Tortoise.
